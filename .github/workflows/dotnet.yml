# This workflow should trigger in the following cases:
#   - The commit is any push in any branch in the repo
#   - The commit is a published PR from anyone else
#
# This setup is done to avoid duplicate runs for the same exact commits, for cases when
# the PR is done from a branch in this repo, which would already trigger the "push"
# condition. This way, only PRs from forks will actually trigger the workflow.
#
# Because we can't really check these conditions from the global triggers here, they are
# added to the two root jobs below instead. If canceled, the whole workflow will stop.
